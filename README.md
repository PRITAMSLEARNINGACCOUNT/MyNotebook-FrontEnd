# MyNotebook-FrontEnd
This is a frontend web app of my web app My-Notebook
I Created this project from a react crash course created by codewithharry which is available for free in youtube,i have learned a lot of things by making this project starting from development and ending with a touch of devops as this whole project is available on vercel and the development is completely done by me.although it is a practice4 project that's why the styles are not professional.
